`setup-specmatic` is an action to set up a [Specmatic](https://specmatic.in) environment for use in actions by:

- Optionally downloading and caching a version of specmatic by version and adding to `PATH`.

## Features

The action offers:

- Creates shell wrapper to call just `specmatic` instead of `java -jar specmatic.jar`
- Adds `specmatic` to the `PATH`
- Speeds up specmatic deployment by using caching mechanics and asynchronous approach

The action will first check the local cache for a version match.  If a version is not found locally,
it will pull it from [specmatic releases](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic/releases).

**Note:** The `setup-specmatic` action uses packages which are built by specmatic side.
The action does not build golang from source code.

## Usage

See [action.yml](https://github.com/airslate-oss/setup-specmatic/blob/main/action.yml)

### Basic

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: actions/setup-specmatic@v1
    with:
      specmatic-version: 0.59.0 # The Specmatic version to download (if necessary) and use.
  - run: specmatic test --testBaseURL='http://127.0.0.1:8030'
```
